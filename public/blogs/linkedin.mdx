Let me make this crystal clear: **you won’t find me on LinkedIn**. Not now, not ever. That platform is a cringe-infested, soul-sucking cesspool of fake personas, corporate ass-kissing, and forced positivity. It’s everything wrong with modern professional culture wrapped up in one obnoxious feed. If you’ve ever scrolled through LinkedIn for more than five minutes, you already know exactly what I’m talking about.

LinkedIn was supposed to be about professional networking, right? Wrong. It’s a circus of people competing to out-cringe each other with performative nonsense and motivational garbage. You’ve got people turning the most mundane events into philosophical epiphanies, saying weird shit like 'I spilled my coffee today, here's what it taught me about B2B... or whatever the fuck', just shut up, shut the fuck up already!

Let’s talk about toxic positivity for a second. Somebody gets fired, and instead of being honest about how much it sucks, they post shit like, 'I’m so grateful for the chance to grow and explore new opportunities.' Bro, you got canned. Your boss tossed you out like yesterday’s trash to save their bottom line. Stop praising the system that screwed you over.

Then there’s the unbearable positivity. LinkedIn has this unspoken rule that everything must be wrapped in fake smiles and corporate buzzwords. Criticism is taboo and freedom of speech is canceled. The result is a feed so fake it makes reality TV look authentic. People posting about how they’re “blessed to work with an amazing team” while probably hating their job. Every post feels like an NPC reciting lines from the corporate script.

 LinkedIn is a mirror for everything wrong with corporate culture. It’s about looking busy and important. It’s about climbing the ladder, polishing your fake-ass persona, and pretending like you’re thriving when you’re probably miserable. LinkedIn amplifies the very things that make corporate life unbearable: relentless self-promotion, superficiality, and an obsession with appearances over substance.

You know what I realized after spending way too much time on that platform? None of it matters. Out of hundreds of connections, maybe five people are actually worth talking to. The rest is noise. LinkedIn doesn’t promote authenticity; it punishes it. If you’re not toeing the line, playing the game, and smiling through your teeth, you’re out of place. It’s exhausting, and I refuse to participate.

If you’re wondering why I’m not there, it’s because I have better shit to do than play the fake corporate game and clout chase on a soulless platform.

LinkedIn is like the Walmart of networking: cheap, fake, and full of people pretending they’ve got their shit together. It’s never been about substance, it’s all about image. If that works for you, fine. But don’t expect me to join in. I’ve got no interest in polishing a fake persona just to fit in with NPCs. If you want to find me, you’ll know where to look.
